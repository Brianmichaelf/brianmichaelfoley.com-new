    <p class="entrepreneur-supporting">Brian Foley is an entrepreneur, surfer, and Founder and CEO of the Buddytruk mobile app. A graduate of Pepperdine, a startup-lover, and someone who has moved far too many times in his life, Brian is on a journey to to simplify the moving and hauling industry.
      <br>
      <br>
      Growing up in Houston, Texas, Foley started working his first job at a gym down the street from his high school at age 14 A year later, he was managing the gym on the weekends, overseeing people twice his age. When it came time for college, manifest destiny took over and Foley set out for Los Angeles, California.  At 18, Foley co-founded a talent agency in Los Angeles to help spread awareness and support for the local artists.
      <br>
      <br>
      While managing the talent agency, Foley connected with one of the artists, Odain Watson, right away. Sharing a similar business mindset, Foley and Watson founded Odaingerous, a clothing line featuring spiked leather jackets and accessories. Odaingerous gained publicity and popularity by putting their jackets on multiple celebrities, like Will.I.Am, Britney Spears, and Justin Bieber. Odaingerous also headlined several fashion events, including one in New York City that was voted as one of the “Top 10 Most Sought after Events” of NYFW 2013.
      <br>
      <br>
      While at Pepperdine University, Foley studied Business and honed in his entrepreneurial spirit by participating in the Entrepreneurial Club. Although he will tell you he was always studying, Foley spent most of his time working on Odaingerous and running a weight-loss studio in Marina Del Rey where he had the chance to act as a “small business owner.”
      <br>
      <br>
      Upon graduation from Pepperdine in 2013, Brian left both the gym and the fashion company to “get a real job.” Unhappy after 4 months as a Financial Advisor, Brian left the corporate world to follow his passion and pursue Buddytruk full-time. In 2016, Brian and his girlfriend, Gina Velasco, co-founded Foley Properties, LLC., a vacation rental real estate business with their first property in Big Bear Lake, CA.
